CodeBook.md 
The description of the variables, the data and the transformations for this project. Each of the steps includes the R code, explanation and the result.

run_analysis.R 
The R code for each of the steps described in the CodeBook.md as per the instructions of the project:
1. Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
2. Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.
3. Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
4. Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names.
5. From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.

TidyData.txt 
The tidy data expected at the end of this project and performed in the last step of the CodeBook.
